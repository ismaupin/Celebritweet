 #Celebritweet

This software was designed by Isaac Maupin to facilitate an online game show during the summer of 2020. Its functionality is quite basic and includes the following features:

Celebritweet: The main feature of this application is to display images stored by the user which are celebrity tweets. Your friends can guess which celebrity tweeted this tweet (this works especially well over ZOOM). In order to control which tweets are displayed, upon launching the program select windows > controls (control + option + C).

From the control panel you have the ability to add new images to the cache of available tweets. In order to do so, press the "Manage Tweets" button. The resulting panel will allow you to add a celebrity name and then to select an image file for the asociated tweet. Please note that you can only add one tweet at a time. If you wish to remove tweets that have been added, select the associated celebrity name from the PopUpMenu under the title Delete Tweets.

Once you have added a satisfactory number of tweets you can display the tweets by selecting them in the controls window. The PopUpMenus labeled "Celebrity One" and "Celebrity Two" control, respectively, images A and B in the display window.

Timer: If the vanilla version of the game has become too boring for you, consider taking things to the next level by including the timer. The timer window can be displayed by selecting Window > Timer(or command + shift + T) from the display window.

Much like the main part of the application, the timer is controlled by an external window. This is accessed by selecting Window > Timer Controls (or control + c) from the timer window.

The timer controls function much like any stopwatch. In the textbox input a desired amount of time for the timer. Click the "Start" button and watch the timer countdown to 0.0. If you click the "Stop" button the timer will be paused and can be resumed by clicking the "Start" button. If you click the "Reset" button the timer will be reset to the time in the textbox. Note that this can be clicked at any time after the timer has been run (even while the timer is running). Additionally, if you update the textbox at anytime, the timer will update to the input amount.
